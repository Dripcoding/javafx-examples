Scenes

- accept a group object which represents a set of node objects
- many type of node objects exist (text, lines, shapes, polygons, images, etc)
- each node should be added to Group before the scene is passed to the stage

- scenes act as containers for various node objects
- scenes act as a "drawing surface" for objects you procedurally code
